LAN function" is required. 
 
● 
Wireless LAN interface WF-RAC needs to be installed in air conditioners. Consult your dealer or a specialist. 
 
● 
Check the application stores for the latest version of Smart M-Air.

● 
Before using the WF-RAC wireless LAN interface, be sure to refer to the "Safety precautions" section of the interface instruction 
manual. 
https://www.mhi-mth.co.jp/en/products/pdf/rkz012a106b_english.pdf 
 
● 
Be sure to operate the air conditioner by voice from inside your home where the registered air conditioner is installed. 
 
● 
Check the condition of the air conditioner, its surroundings and people in the room before operating it. 
 
● 
Make sure that the smart speaker is installed in an appropriate location so that it does not mistakenly react to ambient noise, 
pet sounds, etc. If such an error occurs when you are outside the house, take measures such as turning off the voice 
recognition function of the smart speaker. 
 
● 
If the communication environment is unstable or the smart speaker mishears a voice command due to ambient noise, the air 
conditioner may operate unintentionally. 
 
● 
When using voice commands, make sure that the operation result spoken by the smart speaker is as intended, and check the 
operating status of the air conditioner after the operation. 
 
● 
After changing the operating mode or set temperature from the remote control or Smart M-Air smartphone application, you 
need to acquire the current status if you want to apply it to the smart speaker. 
 
● 
Smart speakers and the Smart M-Air smartphone application can not be operated simultaneously. Wait a while (up to one 
minute) before operating. 
 
● 
If you register an air conditioner on Smart M-Air, you will need to detect it with a smart speaker. 
 
● 
Operation mode "FAN" and "DRY" are not supported. On the remote control or in the Smart M-Air smartphone application, if 
the operating mode is set to FAN or DRY, unintended operation may occur. 
 
● 
Air conditioners manufactured by our company do not support "Routine actions". 
 
● 
If you decide to dispose of your smart speaker or change users, be sure to disable the Alexa skill for Smart M-Air. 
 
● 
In the Alexa application, the air conditioner is registered as a "thermostat." 
 
● 
Operation from the Alexa application is not guaranteed. Use the Smart M-Air application to operate the air conditioner from 
your smartphone.

WARNING 
Note for Using This Product 
When operating the air conditioner away from home, carefully confirm the 
state of the air conditioner, its periphery, and people in the room 
beforehand to ensure safety. Failure to do so may cause death, serious 
injury, or property damage in some cases. 
 
■ Check the following points in advance (while at home). 
 
● The air conditioner must be free from any abnormality. There is no 
adverse effect on persons and the room even when there is a change 
in wind speed etc. (For example, no objects are easily blown away. 
Such objects may fall due to wind, resulting in a fire, injury, or property 
damage.) 
 
● Thoroughly grasp the setting state such as a timer reservation set by 
another person. 
 
(Unexpected operation or stopping may impact health, or may affect 
animals and plants.) 
 
■ Check the following points before operation and while in 
operation from an outdoor location 
 
● If you know someone is in the room with the air conditioner installed, 
notify the person beforehand that you will operate the air conditioner 
from a position where you cannot see it. 
(If the person is on a step, he/she may be surprised and fall by sudden 
operation or stopping. Also, an abrupt change in outdoor and indoor 
temperatures may impact health.) 
•  Temperature control and operation stopping can also be performed 
using the indoor remote control. 
•  Do not use the air conditioner when there are only people in the 
room who cannot control the temperature by themselves such as 
the disabled, the elderly, and infants. 
 
● Frequently check the settings and state of operation. 
(An abrupt change in indoor and outdoor temperatures may impact 
health or may affect animals and plants.) 
•  If the communication state is poor due to radio wave interference 
caused by an obstacle or microwave oven, the operation content 
may not be reflected. 
 
● If an issue occurs in the air conditioner, stop operation immediately and 
consult the sales outlet for the product. Confirm again that the 
operation is stopped on the operation screen.

operated away from home by malicious access, turn OFF the function 
of the wireless LAN interface.
This product cannot be connected directly to communication lines 
provided by telecommunication carriers. When connecting this product 
to the Internet, be sure to connect it to the Internet via a router.
If a barrier that barely transmits a radio wave (such as metal and 
reinforced concrete) exists between this product and a wireless LAN 
router, the product may not operate because it may receive radio wave 
noises or the radio wave reaching distance may be shortened.
Radio waves transmitted from this product have extremely little 
impact on medical electrical devices. However, keep a distance of 20cm 
or more from such a device (pacemaker-installed part, etc.) for safe 
management when using the product.
Use of this product near a device emitting electric waves such as a 
microwave oven and cordless phone may affect communication via 
wireless LAN. If the product fails to communicate properly, or if a 
cordless phone fails to send/receive a call properly, be sure to use the 
product and the phone at least 1 meter away from each other.
If you have any other problems, consult the sales outlet for the product.
